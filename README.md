# Thesis
 This repository includes my Master's degree thesis in which I worked on "Diversity in Bundle Recommendation"
# Thesis Summary: Balancing Relevance and Diversity in Bundle Recommendations

This README provides an overview of the research conducted in the thesis, which explored innovative approaches to create diverse yet relevant product bundles for recommendation systems, with a focus on e-commerce applications.

## Introduction

The thesis addressed the challenge of improving user satisfaction and engagement in recommendation systems by balancing **relevance** and **diversity**. To achieve this, three bundling methods were developed and evaluated:
- **Similarity-Based Method**
- **Bundle Partition Method**
- **Bundle Function Method**

The methods were tested using real-world datasets and advanced evaluation techniques, showcasing their effectiveness in enhancing recommendation quality.

## Datasets

The study utilized datasets from:
- **Amazon Appliances**
- **All_Beauty**
- **Luxury_Beauty**

These datasets included rich metadata such as product descriptions, categories, and user ratings. This enabled the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze item features and assess bundle quality.

## Methods and Metrics

### Bundling Methods:
1. **Similarity-Based Method**: Focused on creating bundles using similar items.
2. **Bundle Partition Method**: Designed to introduce diversity by partitioning items strategically.
3. **Bundle Function Method**: Integrated diversity and relevance metrics into bundle generation.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Intra-List Diversity (ILD)**: Measured the diversity within a bundle.
- **Mean Inverse User Frequency (MIUF)**: Assessed the novelty of recommended items.
- **Average Ratings**: Evaluated the relevance of the bundles.

## Key Findings

### Effectiveness of Bundling Methods
- The **Bundle Partition** and **Bundle Function** methods successfully incorporated diversity without compromising relevance.
- **ILD Scores**: Bundles were more varied and less repetitive compared to the **Similarity-Based** method.
- **Relevance**: High average ratings demonstrated that relevance was maintained across bundles.

### Improved Novelty
- Diversity-focused methods recommended less common (more novel) items, providing users with fresh and engaging recommendations.

### Enhanced User Experience
- The balance of relevance and diversity improved user satisfaction and engagement, addressing redundancy issues in traditional bundle recommendations.

## Future Directions

The thesis identified opportunities for further improvement, including:
- **User Personalization**: Develop dynamic feedback mechanisms to adapt bundles to real-time user preferences.
- **Hybrid Systems**: Combine explicit user actions (e.g., clicks, ratings) and implicit behaviors to refine recommendations over time.

---

## Conclusion

This research demonstrated that **diversity can be successfully incorporated into bundle recommendations without sacrificing relevance**, offering significant benefits for e-commerce and related domains. By addressing redundancy, enhancing novelty, and improving user engagement, this work paves the way for more advanced and personalized recommendation systems.
